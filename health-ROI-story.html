		<p>Public and private entities that fund biomedical research face
			difficult choices on how to allocate a finite level of capital,
			and scientists often take risks in selecting research topics
			multiple times in their academic careers. UNC Charlotte data
			scientist Lixia Yao, in a recently published article in Nature
			Biotechnology titled "Health ROI as a Measure of Misalignment
			of Biomedical Needs and Resources", suggests a better method
			for those funding agencies and scientists.
		</p>
		<p>"We believe that greater returns on investment can be achieved
			for the entire society if we could more effectively distribute
			biomedical research resources, including both funding and human
			capital," said Yao, an assistant professor in the Department of
			Software and Information Systems in the College of Computing and
			Informatics. She worked with collaborators at Columbia University,
			GlaxoSmithKline and the University of Chicago to develop the
			health ROI.
		</p>
		<p>Using the health research opportunity index (ROI), Yao and colleagues
			compared about 1,400 diseases during a 12-year period. Their study was
			based on the numbers of clinical trials and scientific literature and
			treatment costs computed from billions of claim records. The investigators
			uncovered a substantial imbalance between U.S. health needs and research
			investment. For instance, conditions such as breast and cervical cancers
			were over-studied while Hashimoto's thyroiditis (a condition in which one's
			immune system attacks the thyroid) and secondary bone cancer were
			under-studied.
		</p>
		<p>The biomedical research ecosystem is really complex due to the long development
			cycle and the large number of stakeholders, including public and private funding
			agencies, the pharmaceutical industry, patient advocacy groups and the general
			scientific and medical communities.
		</p>
		<p>"If a disease is not perceived as scientifically interesting or if there seems
			little chance of finding a viable or marketable therapy, scientists and pharmaceutical
			company will be unlikely to invest in it," said Yao, who completed a Ph.D. in biomedical
			informatics from Columbia University. "On the other hand, a biomedical breakthrough
			or extreme public attention from those affected or celebrities can tip funding toward
			one disease at the expense of others."
		</p>
		<p>In the example of breast cancer, Yao's health ROI ranked it as the most over-studied
			condition due to the disproportionally large number of clinical trials being conducted.
			"Resource allocation in biomedical research can be impacted by politics, public media
			attention, legal environment, economic conditions and disease burden, et al. My team
			is still working on improving the mathematical model by incorporating more of these
			factors in a quantitative way. We expect to use the health ROI to monitor resource
			allocation for biomedical research much like analysts monitor the stock markets using
			the Dow Jones or NASDAQ indices," Yao stated.
		</p>
		<p>Mirsad Hadzikadic, director of the Complex Systems Institute at UNC Charlotte, added,
			"In this era of Big Data, we have more information available that enables us to examine
			questions in a more systemic manner. Dr. Yao's research exemplifies the power of Big
			Data analysis in minimizing the gap between health needs and biomedical research
			resource allocation. Her methods provide decision-makers the tools to make unbiased
			investment decisions. In the end, we as a society can benefit from more efficient
			allocation of limited research resources."
