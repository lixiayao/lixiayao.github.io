				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In need of emergent medical care, going to the nearest emergency room (ER) might be many American’s first choice. But it is not always the best choice. Hours of waiting time and big-ticket medical bills often disappoint people who visit ER for non life-threatening medical conditions.</p>
<p>Alternatively you can get quicker quality medical care at an urgent care center, mini clinic or walk-in doctor’s office for many urgent but non life-threatening conditions, at much less cost than emergency care. These alternative options are often conveniently located and open evenings, weekends and holidays with licensed doctors, nurses and physician’s assistants.</p>
<p><strong>Urgent care center: </strong>These clinics can usually handle problems that need immediate attention but aren’t life-threatening or emergencies, like stitches, sprains and x-rays.</p>
<p><strong>Mini clinic:</strong> Many major pharmacies and retail stores, such as CVS and Walgreens now have these walk-in clinics staffed by medical professionals. Go there when you need convenient, routine care, like for coughs and flu shots.</p>
<p><strong>Walk-in doctor’s office: </strong>No appointment is needed at these offices, and you usually aren’t required to be an existing patient. This alternative is a good choice when you need simple medical care in a hurry, like for mild asthma or minor allergic reactions.</p>
<p>Below is a list of common health problems these alternatives can treat.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Now we all know that American people have the most expensive healthcare system in the world with mediocre quality (<a href="http://www.transparentmedicalcare.org/blog/obamacare/">click here to read my previous blog</a>). Let us take a closer look at where our healthcare dollars go. Figure 1 shows the breakdown of US healthcare spending in 2011. You can see that the three major items are hospital care (31%), physician and clinical services (21%), and prescription drugs (10%).</p>
<div id="attachment_54" style="width: 659px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://173.254.28.44/~transpb9/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/3_1.jpg"><img class="wp-image-54 size-full" src="http://173.254.28.44/~transpb9/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/3_1.jpg" alt="hospital" width="649" height="513" srcset="http://www.transparentmedicalcare.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/3_1.jpg 649w, http://www.transparentmedicalcare.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/3_1-300x237.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 649px) 100vw, 649px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Figure 1: The breakdown of U.S. healthcare spending in 2011 (Source: http://www.pfizerplus.com/gi/health_care_spending.aspx)</p></div>
<p>So in this article I would like to explain how the hospital bill set their price. Actually this statement is inaccurate &#8211; Hospitals do not set their price the same way a restaurant or airline set their price. Medicare and Medicaid account for 58 % of hospital care in 2012 <a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a>. Consequently, very few hospitals can elect not to participate in Medicare and Medicaid programs. Payment rates for Medicare and Medicaid, with the exception of managed care plans, are set by law rather than through a negotiation process as with private insurers.</p>
<p>Medicare pays hospitals and physicians based on one or more <strong>CPT</strong> (short for <strong><em>Current Procedural Terminology</em></strong>) codes. Each CPT code has a <strong>Relative Value Unit (RVU)</strong>, which captures three components: (1) physician’s work. That is the relative level of time, skill, training and intensity to provide a given service. (2) Practice expense, which includes rent, equipment, supplies and non-physician staff costs. This also includes the hospital overhead to cover the care expenses for uninsured people <a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a>. (3) Malpractice liability expenses. Then after geographic adjustment, a Medicare claim is converted to a real dollar amount for reimbursement based on its CPTs and RVUs.</p>
<p>Private insurance companies negotiate with hospitals. The actual negotiated rates have been kept strictly as business secrets by both hospitals and insurance companies. Thus different hospitals or physicians charge for the same procedure differently and different insurance pays at various rates.</p>
<p>In economics, this practice is called <strong>price discrimination</strong> and is often criticized by its opponents for unfairness. Regardless price discrimination is a very common practice in many fields. For examples, hotel, airline, pharmaceutical, public utilities and universities all charge different consumers at different rates. One distinction between healthcare and other mentioned industries is that the consumers do not know how much the charge will be until the claim goes through. This sometimes generates unpleasant surprises or unpreparable financial burdens to the consumers.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In 2010, President Obama signed the Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare. It is the most comprehensive, ambitious and controversial health system reform in U.S. history. Below I will explain why U.S. need health care reform and what is Obamacare about.</p>
<p><strong>Background</strong>: U.S. spent far more than any other country on health care (See Figure 1), but its quality, efficiency and public health indicators (e.g., Obesity, Diabetes) were mediocre by international standards (See Figure 2 and 3).</p>

<p><strong>Three dimensions of Obamacare</strong>:</p>
<p>1)   <strong>Access</strong>: This part is what we hear most on media. The latest status are as following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Expand Medicaid for most low-income citizens and legal residents; and subsidize private insurance for lower- and middle-income citizens and legal residents who cannot obtain coverage elsewhere.</li>
<li>However U.S. Supreme Court decided in June 2012 that this expansion must be optional for state governments. So far, 27 states voted for Medicaid expansion, 21 states voted against it and 3 states are still debating.</li>
<li>Uninsured individuals with incomes too high to quality for Medicaid can obtain private health insurance on the website of Health Insurance Marketplace.</li>
<li>Insurance companies cannot reject applicants based on their medical history or discriminate them by pricing.</li>
<li>If not purchasing medical insurance, uninsured individuals will require to pay an annual tax penalty.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2, 3) Quality and Cost Control</strong>: Obamacare considers improvements in the quality, efficiency, and effectiveness of medical care as primary approaches both for better quality and cost control. Figure 4 outlines the key components in the law, which affect hospitals, providers, pharmaceutical companies and biomedical researchers more than average patients.</p>
<div id="attachment_39" style="width: 728px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://173.254.28.44/~transpb9/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Figure_4.png"><img class="wp-image-39 size-full" src="http://173.254.28.44/~transpb9/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Figure_4.png" alt="quality and cost control in the Obamacare " width="718" height="404" srcset="http://www.transparentmedicalcare.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Figure_4.png 718w, http://www.transparentmedicalcare.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Figure_4-300x169.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 718px) 100vw, 718px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Figure 4. Key components of quality and cost control in the Obamacare (Source: E. McDonough (2014), “Health System reform in the United States”, International Journal of Health Policy and Management, 2: 5-8.)</p></div>
<p>As of January 1, 2014, implementation of Obamacare reached a stage where repeal of this law is practically no longer possible.</p>

<p>For many foreigners, the US healthcare system can be dauntingly confusing at the beginning. Looking back a decade ago, if I were not a young and healthy international student, I would definitely want to understand the following glossary:</p>
<p><strong>Premium</strong> – Agreed upon fees to provide you (and you family) coverage of medical benefits for a defined benefit period. Premiums are usually paid by both employer and employee in the US.</p>
<p><strong>Deductible</strong> – A fixed amount that an insured person needs to pay <em><strong>before</strong></em> the insurance company starts to pay for his or her covered medical services during the benefit period, usually a year. Plans may have both per individual and family deductibles.</p>
<p><strong>Copayment </strong>– A fee defined by the insurance policy that insured person is required to pay for each time he or she receives a medical service. Insurance companies argues that copayment is a kind of cost sharing mechanism to prevent moral hazard. There may be different copayments for different services. Some plans count copayment as part of deductible, while other plans do not.</p>
<p><strong>Coinsurance</strong> – A specified percentage of medical expenses that an insured person needs to pay after the deductible amount, if any, was paid. After the insured person pays the deductible amount and coinsurance percentage, the insurance company will pay for the rest of the reimbursement for covered expenses up to allowed charges (see maximum out-of-pocket expense and lifetime maximum dollar limit below). In some cases, the insured person could also be responsible for any charges in excess of what the insurance company determines to be “usual, customary and reasonble”.</p>
<p><strong>Maximum out-of-pocket expense</strong> – The maximum amount an insured person needs to pay out of his own pocket during the benefit period. Before this maximum is met, the insurance plan and the insured member shares in the cost of covered medical expenses; after the maximum is reached, the insurance plan pays all covered expenses, often up to a lifetime maximum.</p>
<p><strong>Lifetime maximum dollar limit</strong> – The maximum amount payable by the insurance company for covered expenses for an insured person covered under the health plan.</p>
<p><strong>In-network provider</strong> – A health care provider (e.g., a hospital or doctor) that has an agreement with the insurance company regarding rules and fee schedules so that the patient will not be charged for amounts beyond their agreed upon fee.</p>
<p><strong>Out-of-network provider</strong> – A health care provider who has not contracted with the insurance company for reimbursement at a negotiated rate. Usually the deductibles and coinsurance rates may differ if the medical services are received from an in-network provider or from out-of-network provider.</p>
<p><strong>Primary care physician</strong> – A physician who serves as an insured person’s primary contact within the health plan in non-emergency situations. He or she performs routine medical exams and other uncomplicated medical services and makes referrals to medical specialists when necessary. They can be internists, OB/GYNs or pediatricians.</p>
<p><strong>Flexible spending accounts (FSA)</strong> – Accounts offered and administered by employers that allows employees to set aside certain amount of <em><strong>pretax</strong></em> dollars to pay for their medical and dental expenses not covered by the health plan. Typically the money an employee contributes into his or her FSA account must be used during the benefit year. Otherwise, the excess contributions will be forfeited.
