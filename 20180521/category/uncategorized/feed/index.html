<p>The 2015 budget for the National Institutes of Health (NIH) was $30.4B; the annual investment in biomedical research by the Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI) is about $825M; and the entire pharmaceutical industry spends about $135B annually on R&amp;D. And hundreds of thousands of scientists invest their talents and time doing research with the goal of improving human health and cure diseases. Investments of this magnitude and the social relevance of biomedical research requires us to answer several important questions: What are the unmet medical needs? Are these funds and talents spent effectively to address public health needs? How can we improve the productivity of biomedical research?</p>
<p>Driven by these questions, my colleagues, Dr. Ying Li from Columbia University, Dr. Soumitra Ghosh from GlaxoSmithKline, Dr. <a title="Dr. James Evans" href="http://www.knowledgelab.org/people/detail/james_a_evans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">James Evans</a> and Dr. <a title="Dr. Andrey Rzhetsky" href="http://web.ci.uchicago.edu/research/rzhetsky/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Andrey Rzhetsky</a> from the University of Chicago and I developed a health research opportunity index (ROI) to monitor resource allocation for biomedical research, much like analysts use the Dow Jones index to monitor the stock markets, or scientists use H-index to measure the productivity and impact of their work. This work titled “<a title="Nature Biotechnology" href="http://www.nature.com/nbt/journal/v33/n8/full/nbt.3276.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Health ROI as a Measure of Misalignment of Biomedical Needs and Resources</a>” is published in Nature Biotechnology in August.</p>
<p>Based on the numbers of clinical trials and scientific literature and treatment costs computed from billions of claim records, we calculated and compared the health ROI for about 1,400 diseases during a 12-year period. The results showed a substantial imbalance between U.S. health needs and research investment.</p>
<p>For example, breast cancer stands out as one of the most over-studied disease over the past decade. Led by large dedicated foundations, fundraising for breast cancer research and clinical trials has been hugely successful, even as budgets for national funding agencies such as the NIH have shrunk. The success of the <a href="http://ww5.komen.org/uploadedfiles/content_binaries/the_pink_ribbon_story.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pink ribbon</a> campaign is a huge testament to the efforts of all of those involved. These efforts have enabled breast cancer to be the highest-funded cancer type in fiscal year 2013 for <a href="http://fundedresearch.cancer.gov/nciportfolio/search/funded?type=site&amp;fy=PUB2013" target="_blank" rel="noopener">grants awarded</a> by the National Cancer Institute, despite the fact that breast cancer is not the deadliest type of cancer. Lung cancer causes the most cancer deaths worldwide, with <a href="http://www.cancer.org/acs/groups/content/@editorial/documents/document/acspc-044552.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">158,040 lung cancer deaths</a> expected in the US this year alone. Yet lung cancer research received less than half the NIH funding that breast cancer did in 2014.</p>
<p>In order to increase funds to breast cancer, those research dollars come at the expense of other conditions. <a href="http://www.uchospitals.edu/online-library/content=P00406" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hashimoto’s thyroiditis</a> falls among the conditions with the most investment potential. It is the most common cause of hypothyroidism and occurs when the immune system attacks the thyroid gland, thus disrupting the body’s balance of hormones. As of August, 2015, there are 16 open clinical trials for Hashimoto’s disease according to clinicaltrials.gov. Breast cancer has 2,205.</p>
<p>If a disease is not perceived as scientifically interesting, scientists will unlikely to research on it. If there seems little chance of finding a viable or marketable therapy, pharmaceutical company will be unlikely to invest in it. If a disease area or technology is not trendy, funding agencies will bypass it and fund more stylish projects. We acknowledge that the question of what makes a condition more deserving of resources than others remains open to debate. But we believe big data analysis could minimize the gap between health needs and biomedical research resource allocation and provide decision-makers the tools to make unbiased investment decisions.</p>
<p>Our team will continue to improve the Health ROI by incorporating more factors, such as public media and patents in a quantitative way. If you are from public and private funding agencies, the pharmaceutical industry, patient advocacy groups and the general scientific and medical communities, or you are simply interested in this topic, we would like to hear your thoughts or suggestions.
