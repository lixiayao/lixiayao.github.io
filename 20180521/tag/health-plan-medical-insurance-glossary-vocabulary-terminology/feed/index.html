<p>For many foreigners, the US healthcare system can be dauntingly confusing at the beginning. Looking back a decade ago, if I were not a young and healthy international student, I would definitely want to understand the following glossary:</p>
<p><strong>Premium</strong> – Agreed upon fees to provide you (and you family) coverage of medical benefits for a defined benefit period. Premiums are usually paid by both employer and employee in the US.</p>
<p><strong>Deductible</strong> – A fixed amount that an insured person needs to pay <em><strong>before</strong></em> the insurance company starts to pay for his or her covered medical services during the benefit period, usually a year. Plans may have both per individual and family deductibles.</p>
<p><strong>Copayment </strong>– A fee defined by the insurance policy that insured person is required to pay for each time he or she receives a medical service. Insurance companies argues that copayment is a kind of cost sharing mechanism to prevent moral hazard. There may be different copayments for different services. Some plans count copayment as part of deductible, while other plans do not.</p>
<p><strong>Coinsurance</strong> – A specified percentage of medical expenses that an insured person needs to pay after the deductible amount, if any, was paid. After the insured person pays the deductible amount and coinsurance percentage, the insurance company will pay for the rest of the reimbursement for covered expenses up to allowed charges (see maximum out-of-pocket expense and lifetime maximum dollar limit below). In some cases, the insured person could also be responsible for any charges in excess of what the insurance company determines to be “usual, customary and reasonble”.</p>
<p><strong>Maximum out-of-pocket expense</strong> – The maximum amount an insured person needs to pay out of his own pocket during the benefit period. Before this maximum is met, the insurance plan and the insured member shares in the cost of covered medical expenses; after the maximum is reached, the insurance plan pays all covered expenses, often up to a lifetime maximum.</p>
<p><strong>Lifetime maximum dollar limit</strong> – The maximum amount payable by the insurance company for covered expenses for an insured person covered under the health plan.</p>
<p><strong>In-network provider</strong> – A health care provider (e.g., a hospital or doctor) that has an agreement with the insurance company regarding rules and fee schedules so that the patient will not be charged for amounts beyond their agreed upon fee.</p>
<p><strong>Out-of-network provider</strong> – A health care provider who has not contracted with the insurance company for reimbursement at a negotiated rate. Usually the deductibles and coinsurance rates may differ if the medical services are received from an in-network provider or from out-of-network provider.</p>
<p><strong>Primary care physician</strong> – A physician who serves as an insured person’s primary contact within the health plan in non-emergency situations. He or she performs routine medical exams and other uncomplicated medical services and makes referrals to medical specialists when necessary. They can be internists, OB/GYNs or pediatricians.</p>
<p><strong>Flexible spending accounts (FSA)</strong> – Accounts offered and administered by employers that allows employees to set aside certain amount of <em><strong>pretax</strong></em> dollars to pay for their medical and dental expenses not covered by the health plan. Typically the money an employee contributes into his or her FSA account must be used during the benefit year. Otherwise, the excess contributions will be forfeited. In 2014, the annual limit is $2,500 each employee.</p>
