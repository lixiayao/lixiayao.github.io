				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Now we all know that American people have the most expensive healthcare system in the world with mediocre quality (<a href="http://www.transparentmedicalcare.org/blog/obamacare/">click here to read my previous blog</a>). Let us take a closer look at where our healthcare dollars go. Figure 1 shows the breakdown of US healthcare spending in 2011. You can see that the three major items are hospital care (31%), physician and clinical services (21%), and prescription drugs (10%).</p>

<p>So in this article I would like to explain how the hospital bill set their price. Actually this statement is inaccurate &#8211; Hospitals do not set their price the same way a restaurant or airline set their price. Medicare and Medicaid account for 58 % of hospital care in 2012 <a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a>. Consequently, very few hospitals can elect not to participate in Medicare and Medicaid programs. Payment rates for Medicare and Medicaid, with the exception of managed care plans, are set by law rather than through a negotiation process as with private insurers.</p>
<p>Medicare pays hospitals and physicians based on one or more <strong>CPT</strong> (short for <strong><em>Current Procedural Terminology</em></strong>) codes. Each CPT code has a <strong>Relative Value Unit (RVU)</strong>, which captures three components: (1) physician’s work. That is the relative level of time, skill, training and intensity to provide a given service. (2) Practice expense, which includes rent, equipment, supplies and non-physician staff costs. This also includes the hospital overhead to cover the care expenses for uninsured people <a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a>. (3) Malpractice liability expenses. Then after geographic adjustment, a Medicare claim is converted to a real dollar amount for reimbursement based on its CPTs and RVUs.</p>
<p>Private insurance companies negotiate with hospitals. The actual negotiated rates have been kept strictly as business secrets by both hospitals and insurance companies. Thus different hospitals or physicians charge for the same procedure differently and different insurance pays at various rates.</p>
<p>In economics, this practice is called <strong>price discrimination</strong> and is often criticized by its opponents for unfairness. Regardless price discrimination is a very common practice in many fields. For examples, hotel, airline, pharmaceutical, public utilities and universities all charge different consumers at different rates. One distinction between healthcare and other mentioned industries is that the consumers do not know how much the charge will be until the claim goes through. This sometimes generates unpleasant surprises or unpreparable financial burdens to the consumers.</p>
