		<p>Assistant Professor Lixia Yao, Ph.D., has been selected to receive a Career Development Award
			in Biomedical Informatics from the National Library of Medicine at the National Institute of Health.
			This very competitive award is designed to provide junior faculty the support and "protected time" for
			an intensive career development in biomedical informatics leading to research independence.
		</p>
		<p>The three-year award, totaling $535,446, will fund Dr. Yao's systematical investigation into resource
			allocation in biomedical research and further development of an innovative tool called Research
			Opportunity Index (ROI).
		</p>
		<p>“This research idea is based on a completely out-of-box thinking of resource allocation in biomedicine
			from the perspective of a data scientist.” says Yao.  “I am truly excited to see that the National Library
			of Medicine has selected it for funding. I welcome talented students at UNC Charlotte to participate in
			this innovative project. We will refine and expand the current ROI model and make it useful to various
			stakeholders in biomedical research in the next three years.”
		</p>
		<p>ROI is a quantitative measure of disparities between resources dedicated to a disease and its
			relative burden on society. It is designed to provide an unbiased, data-driven framework to help
			scientific, investment, and political communities assess resource investment and identify unmet medical
			needs. Her early work on developing ROI was published in the August issue of Nature Biotechnology in 2015.
		</p>
		<p>Yao received her Ph.D. degree in Biomedical Informatics from Columbia University in 2010. She then
			worked as a Principal Investigator at GlaxoSmithKline Pharmaceuticals prior to joining UNC Charlotte
			in 2013. She now leads a team of data scientists and healthcare professionals at the Health Informatics
			Lab, and collaborates with world-class scholars and clinicians. Dr. Yao’s research focuses on mining,
			integrating, and transforming unstructured, incomplete, and noisy data (i.e., electronic health records
			and claims databases, literature, patents, and social media) into meaningful biomedical knowledge and
			healthcare IT applications.
